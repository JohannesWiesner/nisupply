# nisupply
A python library for dealing with unstructured neuroimaging datasets that do not conform to BIDS. For more information about BIDS
visit http://bids.neuroimaging.io. This library is intended to be used along [pybids](https://github.com/bids-standard/pybids) and is supposed to contain helper functions that facilitate 
the transformation of unstructured data sets to BIDS-conform data sets.
